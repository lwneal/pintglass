Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

When I was shown the charts and diagrams, 
to add, divide, and measure them,
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured 
with much applause in the lecture-room,
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
Till rising and gliding out 
I wander’d off by myself,
In the mystical moist night-air
